# Book-Shop
NodeJs API for an online book shop
I used MVC like structure for this project and for the database I used MongoDB and using mongoose package for handling requests and I used JWT(Json Web Token) for authenticating process.
I did not add .env file to this project so you must add MONGO_URL(Database address), JWT_KEY to your .env file by yourself.
